# Validation for Système de Gestion de version
- Each member must have created a Github account and joined the team assigned to him
- Each member should have made several significant commits  
  - The commits have a relevant title ([see for examples](http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html))
  - The commits contain modifications of the project (addition or deletion) (no empty commits)
- The final project contains contributions from all contributors 
- The project will contain at least a main branch and a release branch
    - The release branch points to the "final" version of the project that will be deployed online
- Demonstrating mastery of other elements of the version control system will result in a higher score

# Validation for Developement Web Statique : HTML and CSS Validation 
You can find below hint on the HTML and CSS validation of your project. **It does not replace actual validation with the [official validator for the class](https://devweb.estia.fr/validator/)**, but serves as the remainder. The badges can take several minutes to update, wait and refresh to be sure.  

- Current status on the release branch : ![HTML VALIDATIOn](../../actions/workflows/validateHTML.yml/badge.svg?branch=release)
- Current status the main branch : ![HTML VALIDATIOn](../../actions/workflows/validateHTML.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)
