# HTML and CSS Validation 
You can find below hint on the HTML and CSS validation of your project. **It does not replace actual validation with the [official validator for the class](https://devweb.estia.fr/validator/)**, but serves as the remainder. The badges can take several minutes to update, wait and refresh to be sure.
