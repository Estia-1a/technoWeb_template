# HTML and CSS Validation 
You can find below hint on the HTML and CSS validation of your project. **It does not replace actual validation with the [w3c validation](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri)**, but serves as the remainder. The badges can take several minutes to update, wait and refresh to be sure.
